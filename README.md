Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

Several Projects in BUAA Object-Oriented Programming course, including Single-Thread Elevator, Multi-Thread Elevators, File System Monitor and 100-Thread Taxi Dispatch System.

Most projects have conducted sufficient correctness analysis and unit tests to ensure the correctness of the system.

If you have any questions about these projects, please feel free to ask me.:)
